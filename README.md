# DataForGood Walkthrough

In this walkthrough, we will be working with data collected from Kaggle's second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey. 
The objective of our analysis is to build a predictive model to help us understand the technical differentiators between 
the Data Scientist, Data Analyst and Data Engineer role.
